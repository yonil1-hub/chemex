# ChemEX - Chemical Engineering Made Easy

## Introduction

#### Chemex is tutorial website for Chemical engineers
Our website was created with the goal of providing a comprehensive and user-friendly resource for students and professionals in the chemical engineering field. We understand that finding quality resources for chemical engineering courses can be challenging, and that is why we began working on this project. Our aim is to create a platform where users can share their own tutorial with others, creating a community of learners and educators dedicated to advancing the field of chemical engineering. 

## Project Description
In this web project, anyone with the link can access the website and read the tutorials. However, in order to submit a tutorial, comment on tutorial posts, or reply to them, users must first register and become members of the website. Tutors who have registered can upload tutorials (in Microsoft format) to the server, which will then be converted to HTML and preserved in the original format. After being sanitized, the tutorial will be added to the database.
The tutorial has the following categories.

- Biotechnology
- Chemistry
- Fluid Mechanics
- Material Engineering
- Reaction Engineering
- Thermodynamics
